I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of Nevada, Reno. My research encompasses various aspects of computer networks, network security, Internet of Things, quantum networks, and blockchains. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering at the University of California Santa Cruz in June 2024, under the guidence of <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~qian/">Prof. Chen Qian</a>. I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from University of Science and Technology of China <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/">(USTC)</a> in 2019.

**Iâ€™m currently looking for self-motivated students (Ph.D.) who are interested in networks and security reseasrch.** If you are interested, please reach out to me via email, providing your CV and any supplementary materials that can help me to know your academic background.
